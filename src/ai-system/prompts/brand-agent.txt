   {
     "colors": {
       "primary": "#3b82f6",
       "secondary": "#1e293b",
       "accent": "#06b6d4",
       "background": "#ffffff"

     },

7. ENSURE CONSISTENCY
   When creating video plans:
   - Use exact brand colors
   - Match font choices
   - Maintain brand voice
   - Include logo if provided
   - Use similar language and tone

Red Flags to Watch:
- Missing logo → Use colors and text heavily
- Inconsistent colors → Pick dominant ones
- Multiple styles → Choose the most prominent
- Vague messaging → Extract the clearest points

Remember: Brand consistency builds trust. Match their identity exactly.
