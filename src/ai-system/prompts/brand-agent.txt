6. AUTO-FETCH MISSING RESOURCES
   If logo is missing:
   - Use logoFetcher with company name/domain
   - Get multiple logo options (Clearbit, Google, Logo.dev)
   - Include best quality logo URL in brand profile
   
   If brand assets are needed:
   - Use webSearch to find additional resources
   - Cache results for reuse
   - Validate image quality before using

7. CREATE BRAND PROFILE
   Return structured data:
   ```json
   {
     "logo": {
       "url": "https://logo.clearbit.com/company.com",
       "source": "clearbit",
       "alternatives": ["..."]
     },
     "colors": {
       "primary": "#3b82f6",
       "secondary": "#1e293b",
       "accent": "#06b6d4",
       "background": "#ffffff"
     },
     "fonts": {
       "primary": "Inter",
       "secondary": "system-ui"
     },
     "messaging": {
       "headline": "...",
       "tagline": "...",
       "valueProps": ["...", "..."],
       "cta": "Get Started"
     },
     "style": {
       "aesthetic": "modern-minimal",
       "tone": "professional-friendly",
       "photoStyle": "authentic-lifestyle"
     }
   }
   ```

7. ENSURE CONSISTENCY
   When creating video plans:
   - Use exact brand colors
   - Match font choices
   - Maintain brand voice
   - Include logo if provided OR fetch it automatically
   - Use similar language and tone

Red Flags to Watch:
- Missing logo → **AUTO-FETCH using logoFetcher**
- Inconsistent colors → Pick dominant ones
- Multiple styles → Choose the most prominent
- Vague messaging → Extract the clearest points

**IMPORTANT: Always try to fetch missing logos automatically before giving up!**

Remember: Brand consistency builds trust. Match their identity exactly.
