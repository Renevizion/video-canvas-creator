## 🎥 **2. CAMERA PERSPECTIVES & POV CHANGES**

### Camera Techniques Observed

#### **Dynamic Camera Movement**
1. **Close-up Introduction (Frame 1)**
   - Extreme close-up of rocket character
   - Creates intimacy and focuses attention
   - Left-side framing with negative space

2. **Pull-Back Reveal (Frames 1-10)**
   - Camera "zooms out" to reveal full scene
   - Character transforms from detail to full figure
   - Environment context gradually revealed

3. **Centered Composition (Frame 10)**
